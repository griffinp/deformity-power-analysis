This code was used to perform a posteriori power analyses
on ecotoxicology lab experiments that aimed to investigate the 
relationship between sublethal stressors (copper, imidacloprid, 
food limitation) and chironomid deformity rates. 

The experiments and power analysis methods are detailed in

an environmental stress response: sublethal toxicological assays
and noncontaminant biological factors (in preparation)
